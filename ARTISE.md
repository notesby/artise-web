# Artise for the web

A branded fork of [Element Web](https://github.com/element-hq/element-web) (AGPL-3.0), served at
chat.artise.co. The Android app is the same idea: [artise-android](https://github.com/notesby/artise-android).

## Branches

- `development`: Artise, deployable. Work happens on `feature/*` branches merged into it.
- `upstream` remote: element-hq/element-web. Element releases are merged in by tag
  (`git fetch upstream --tags && git merge v1.12.31`); Artise changes stay small and in clearly named places so
  those merges stay easy.

## Building and deploying

- `.github/workflows/artise-build.yml` builds `apps/web/Dockerfile` on every push to `development` and publishes
  `ghcr.io/notesby/artise-web:development` and `:sha-<commit>`. Element's own workflows are disabled in the
  repository settings (they'd run their whole CI on every push).
- The server (family-wiki `deploy/docker-compose.yml`) pins the image by digest, like every other image there, and
  mounts its own `config.json` over `/app/config.json`.
- Locally: `corepack enable --install-directory ~/.local/bin pnpm`, then `pnpm install` and
  `cd apps/web && pnpm start`. See AGENTS.md for tests and linting.
